ExeProcessManager is a powerful and lightweight tool for managing and monitoring system processes, written in Go. This project allows you to run your processes manually or on a schedule, view their status, and interact with them through a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a secure REST API.

‚ú® Features
Full Process Lifecycle Management: Add, start, stop, remove, and view the status of processes.

State Persistence: The state of all processes is saved to disk, ensuring no data is lost after an application restart.

Scheduling: Define timing rules to automatically execute processes at a future time.

Dual Interface:

Command-Line Interface (CLI): For direct and fast management from the terminal.

REST API: For integration with other services and remote management.

API Security: All API routes are protected using secret API Keys.

Easy Configuration: All application settings are managed through a single config.json file.

Structured Logging: All events are logged in a standard format for easy debugging and monitoring.

Graceful Shutdown: The application listens for system signals (like Ctrl+C) and shuts down gracefully to ensure data integrity.

Comprehensive Tests: High test coverage to ensure the stability and correctness of the core application.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

Prerequisites
Go version 1.21 or higher must be installed.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ExeProcessManager

Configure the application:
Create a copy of the config.json file and modify its values according to your needs.

{
  "data_directory": "./data",
  "schedule_directory": "./schu",
  "log_level": "info",
  "api_listen_address": ":8080",
  "api_keys": [
    "your-secret-api-key-1",
    "another-secure-key-for-admin"
  ]
}

Important: Replace the api_keys with your own secure, randomly generated keys.

Build the project:

go build -o exepm .

This command creates an executable file named exepm (exepm.exe on Windows).

Run the application:

./exepm

Running this command will activate both the CLI and the API server.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Command-Line Interface (CLI)
After running the application, you can enter the following commands in your terminal:

Command

Description

help

Show the list of all available commands.

list

List all managed processes.

add <name> <path> <sch>

Add a new process (sch: 0=manual, 1=auto).

start <name> [args...]

Start a manual process by its name.

stop <name>

Stop a running process.

status <name>

Show the detailed status of a process.

remove <name>

Completely remove a process from the manager.

REST API
All requests to the API must include the X-API-KEY header with a valid key.

Example: Get the list of processes with curl

# Set your API key in this variable
API_KEY="your-secret-api-key-1"

curl -H "X-API-KEY: $API_KEY" http://localhost:8080/processes

Main API Endpoints:

‚úÖ Running Tests
To ensure all parts of the project are working correctly, you can run the unit tests:

go test ./...

üîÆ Future Work
Resource Monitoring: Add the ability to monitor CPU and memory usage for each process.

Auto-Restart: Implement an auto-restart mechanism for processes that crash.

Advanced Scheduling: Support Cron-style scheduling rules.

Web UI: Build a web-based dashboard with React/Vue for graphical process management.

Log Management: Stream live logs from each process to the Web UI.

Notification System: Send alerts via Slack or Telegram on process failure.
